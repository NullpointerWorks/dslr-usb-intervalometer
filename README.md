# DSLR Intervalometer

There are a number of Canon DSLRs that allow for an external shutter release using a 3-terminal 2.5mm audio jack. You can purchase the hand-held intervalometers online, but using those can be somewhat inconvenient. They either don't save their last configuration, or they can't store any for later use. Not to mention configuring the device can be a pain in the butt. 

The purpose of this project is to replace the clunky battery-powered intervalometer with a USB powered device. You can now automate the DSLR's exposure time using a desktop application and a piece of electronics. The application will save your DSLR profiles and should be a lot easier to set up. 

## Supported DSLR's
There are a handful of Canon DSLRs that come equipped with a 2.5mm external shutter release interface. I own a Canon 350D (astro-modified) and 1100D and confirmed it works on both of them. The list below is not an exhaustive list. Some models may be missing.
